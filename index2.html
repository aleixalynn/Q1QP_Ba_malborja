                A person’s health does not only affects their quality of life, but also affects them 
                financially. Either unhealthy habits or genetics cause these sicknesses. Through this research, we 
                can understand medical expenses considering the factors stated below.
                <br>

                <br>
                Our research discusses the prediction of medical costs based on the 
                characteristics and lifestyle of an individual. But first, let us define medical costs. 
                From the term itself it is how much an individual spends on medical treatment depending on their needs and illness. 
                Factors like being a smoker, and the individual’s region are set as our qualitative variables as they tell us more 
                about the individual’s qualities. Quantitative variables on the other hand are the following: their body mass index 
                as a health indicator and their charges or medical costs, the amount they paid for medical costs. These are variables that dwell more on numerical 
                values in understanding and knowing the individuals.
